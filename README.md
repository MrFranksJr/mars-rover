# Mars Rover Development Program

### Description

This exercise is an adaption off the well known [Mars rover kata](https://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata). The full functional requirements can be found [here](REQUIREMENTS.md)

### Format program

The goal of this exercise is to focus on development technique, not on technology. So you should be able to do everything with pure code. This code repository contains some simple start code to get things going. I've chosen to use java 21, maven and junit5. However, feel free to throw it away and do it in other way. 

**The sole requirement is that the application can be run using the 'marsrover' command.** 
Since this is how the users wil use you application. If this command does not work, your application does not work! 

### Getting started

If you checked out the code make sure that the launch command works. 

This is what you should see on windows

```batch
>marsrover.bat
**************************
**    MarsRover       **
**************************
> q to quit
```

This is what you should see on mac/linux

```batch
>./MarsRover
**************************
**    MarsRover       **
**************************
> q to quit
```

### Problems

```batch
Fatal error compiling: error: release version 16 not supported
```

This means that you need to install the correct JDK.
