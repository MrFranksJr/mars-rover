# Level 4 Use cases

Now that we have multiple rovers running around at the same time in our simulation, it is perhaps time to introduce Time :-)

## Introducing Time

The simulation needs a notion of time.

+ When the simulation is created we start at T0. When a Tempo passes it goes to T1, T2 etc...
+ Landing a Rover, executing a Rover Command all takes one Tempo.
+ Multiple Rovers can execute a single instruction at the same time.
+ For diagnostic purposes we can retrieve an event log from the simulation with the time present.

[Please enter a command] : land 1 1

[Please enter a command] : land 2 2

## Programming Rovers

We should be able to program the Rovers with instructions that they then execute when being instructed to do so. So we want to be able to send a program towards
the Rovers that can then be executed when given the signal. This will allow us to have multiple Rovers executing instructions at the same time, not in sequence.

We introduce two new commands. A register command to program the rovers and an execute command that executes the stored programs of the rovers.
